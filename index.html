      <h1>An Exclusive Invitation from Lux Lox Salon</h1>
      <p><strong>Dear Valued Guest,</strong></p>
      <p>
        At Lux Lox Salon, we deeply value the trust and loyalty you’ve shown us over the years. As one of our cherished guests, we are excited to offer you something truly special—an exclusive opportunity to join our new Membership Program designed with you in mind.
      </p>
      <h2>Why This Membership Matters</h2>
      <h3>Preferred Rates & Tangible Savings</h3>
      <p>
        As a member, you’ll pay significantly less than new guests, ensuring your loyalty is rewarded in a tangible way. Depending on the package you choose, you’ll save between $105 and $588 (or more!) over standard service costs.
      </p>
      <h3>Complimentary Deep Condition Steam Treatments</h3>
      <p>
        Enjoy exclusive add-ons each time you visit. Depending on your membership tier, you’ll receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 free Deep Condition Steam Treatment (valued at $50)</li>
        <li>2 free treatments (valued at $100)</li>
        <li>3 free treatments (valued at $150)</li>
        <li>4 free treatments (valued at $200)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Discounts on Retail & Other Services</h3>
      <p>
        Get up to 10%, 15%, or 20% off retail purchases and other hair services, plus rollover appointments if you need added flexibility.
      </p>
      <h2>Membership Spots Are Limited</h2>
      <p>
        We’re keeping memberships small so we can focus on delivering premium, personalized experiences for each member. Your invitation is special—not everyone will have access to this offer.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Now?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Upcoming Price Adjustment</strong><br />
        We will be slightly increasing our standard rates effective February 1st. We haven’t raised prices since before COVID, even while our product costs increased by 50%–100% in many cases. This adjustment allows us to maintain the highest level of service you’ve come to expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Continued Excellence</strong><br />
        Our new pricing structure is based on careful market research that reflects your stylist’s skill level, advanced training, and years of experience. By offering a membership program alongside this shift, we ensure you can continue enjoying your favorite services at a rate far below what new guests will pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership may not fit everyone. If you prefer a more flexible approach, we’d love to recommend Hanna E., a talented stylist in Lux Lox Salon who has trained extensively under our methods and consistently performs at a high level.
      </p>
